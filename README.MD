# Asynchronous API Request 
How to make a request from JS in different ways to catch data from a PHP service. This code contains several types of requests. (Code that does not correspond to the current example is commented). You can find all the commented-code examples in different repos:
- Async-API-request-ajax-JSON
- Async-API-request-ajax-Querystring
- Async-API-request-fetch-JSON
- Async-API-request-fetch-Querystring

`[SimPIL are a series of ultra-simple examples of how to perform different operations with code. Uncomplicated.]`

## Install
Simply clone the repo and run the code from Apache server. Load index.html. 

## Perform
By clicking on the `call` button, a fetch with params (or without it) for the PHP service will be carried out and will load a JSON.
